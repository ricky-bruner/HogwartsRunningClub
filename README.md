# Welcome the the Hogwarts Running Club!

Before you is the very beginning of my Back-End Capstone for NSS!

Initially, the plan for this project is to build an Social Platform for the Hogwarts Running Club!

### What is the HRC?

Hogwarts Running Club is an amazing non-profit organization that host Harry Potter themed virtual runs for members to participate it! Members purchase a medal, and proceeds go directly to various charities, as each race supports a different Charity! HRC has nearly 70,000 members that have raised over $2.5 million and ran for over 8 million miles! Each race has a unique running medal, and the price is typically $25 per race.

### The Plan for a Place to Practice Magic

The current vision is to give users the ability to register, sort themself into a Hogwarts House, and provide each House with a Common Room within which users can create topics, comment on topics, and share fitness triumps!

Users will also have a profile section where they can manage their workouts, track miles run, and view a collection of races that they've participated in!

The hope for the future is to give users a common area to post images and statuses, beyond what a forum setup can offer. Users will also be able to add friends and view their posts and images.

Until more build-out is complete, this remains the sole plan!
